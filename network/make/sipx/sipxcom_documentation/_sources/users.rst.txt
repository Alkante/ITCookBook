Users Tab
=========
The users tab includes the Admin Roles, Users, and User Group menu items.

Admin Roles
-----------
The default administrator account within the sipxcom webui is "superadmin". The superadmin user has access to all configuration items and menus, where normal users do not. Admin roles can be created to grant (or restrict) admin access to a normal user or group of normal users.

Users
-----
There are two types of users - regular or phantom. A phantom user is not allowed to register to the system. Phantoms are only used for call routing purposes or as a general voicemail box.

User Groups
-----------
User groups are useful to set configuration items on groups of users. For example a 'novoicemail' group that removes the voicemail permission.
