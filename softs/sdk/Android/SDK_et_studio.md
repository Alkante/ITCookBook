Android stutio = IDE + DSK

    Unpack the downloaded ZIP file into an appropriate location for your applications.
    To launch Android Studio, navigate to the android-studio/bin/ directory in a terminal and execute studio.sh.

    You may want to add android-studio/bin/ to your PATH environmental variable so that you can start Android Studio from any directory.
    If the SDK is not already installed, follow the setup wizard to install the SDK and any necessary SDK tools.

    Note: You may also need to install the ia32-libs, lib32ncurses5-dev, and lib32stdc++6 packages. These packages are required to support 32-bit apps on a 64-bit machine.

```
apt-get install ia32-libs lib32ncurses5-dev lib32stdc++6
```
